# A virtual environment is a tool used to isolate specific Python environments on a single machine, 
# allowing you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies and packages without conflicts. 
# This can be especially useful when working on projects that have conflicting package versions or 
# packages that are not compatible with each other.

# To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the venv module that comes with Python. 
# Here's an example of how to create a virtual environment and activate it:

# Create a virtual environment

# python -m venv myenv

# # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
# source myenv/bin/activate

# # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
# myenv\Scripts\activate.bat


# # Deactivate the virtual environment
# deactivate

# # Output the list of installed packages and their versions to a file
# pip freeze > requirements.txt

# # Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
# pip install -r requirements.txt
